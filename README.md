Project Description: 
This project was a part of my ReactJS learning course. However, during the course we did it only in plain react. After i learned Redux, I decided to rewrite this app with Redux state and change the styling of the application. The application is used to take orders at an fictional restaurant called home grill. You can see a menu on the left side of the application with some different selection for foods and drinks. Inside them you can find items, which can be added to the table orders inside the orders tab. By pressing Check Out on the table you will clear the tables orders and send the information to Statistics tab, where you can see your total sales and the count of items sold. Tab Settings is for adding new items to your menu that can be found inside Special tab
